/**
 * Finds and runs the code generator.
 *
 * Elephentity compiles specs. Turning the result into files is a separate program —
 * `eleph-codegen`, which resolves a project's builders, runs them, and signs and writes
 * what they return. This is the whole of the coupling between them: a path to an
 * executable and JSON on its stdin.
 *
 * **Resolution, never acquisition**, exactly as the generator treats its own builders.
 * Four places, in order: an explicit `"codegen"` path in eleph.json; alongside the
 * `eleph` binary that is running, which is where Composer puts both; the nearest
 * `vendor/bin` above this file, which is where it is when `eleph` is run from its own
 * source rather than from `vendor/bin`; then `PATH`. When none of them has it the error
 * names all four, because "not found" without saying where it looked is the least
 * useful thing a build can say.
 *
 * Output is forwarded rather than re-rendered. The generator owns how a run is reported
 * — which files changed, which had been hand-edited, which target is out of date — and a
 * wrapper that restated any of that would be a second thing to keep in step with a
 * report it does not produce.
 *
 * *How* it is forwarded depends on where it is going. Attached to a terminal the child
 * inherits this process's streams directly, so it decides about colour and its progress
 * appears as it happens. Anywhere else — a pipe, CI, a test — it is captured and written
 * back out through the caller's output, because a command whose child wrote straight to
 * file descriptor 1 could not be redirected, silenced or asserted on, and would leak
 * through any harness that thought it had captured it.
